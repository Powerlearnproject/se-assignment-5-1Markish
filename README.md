   Extensions play a crucial role in Visual Studio Code by enhancing its functionality and customizing the editor to fit specific development needs. They can add support for new programming languages, debuggers, and tools, as well as integrate with external services and improve overall productivity.


6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

   The integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows you to run command-line tools directly within the editor, providing a seamless development experience. It is aware of the workspace context, meaning it opens in the root directory of your project. You can access it by using the command ctrl + shift + `
